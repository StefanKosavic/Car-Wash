(If you do not have time to review the entire code for the project,
above is a video where you can see the functionality and some parts of the page in action.)

TASK

Build REST API using a technology you feel most comfortable with, that should support 
handling business operations of a car wash facility and create a front-end to utilize and 
consume that API

The car wash facility should be able to:
- Create a customer
- Customers can be billed in different ways, depending on their loyalty, so for example 
each 10th run will have an additional discount.
- The facility can have multiple washing programs.
- Each program consists of steps and these steps should be able to be combined into a 
washing program
- We need to track all the activities
